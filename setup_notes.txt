### Notes
- notebooks are tested in jupyterlab (extension for jupyter-notebook)
- need gcc4.9+ (tested on gcc7) to install pippi
- need nodejs5+ for some jupyterlab widgets
- Since gcc and nodejs are required for parts of this project, a miniconda environment is ideal https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
	conda install -c conda-forge nodejs
	conda install -c creditx gcc-7
### Enable jupyter widgets:
conda install -c conda-forge ipywidgets
jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension
jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager
